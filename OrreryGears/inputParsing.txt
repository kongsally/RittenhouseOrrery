/*Explanation and Objectives*/
/*each line of the txt file represents one gear's input information
in the form of such as "name" "teethNum" "sisters(given sisters' names)" "children(given children's names)"
Parsing is done by line and by the space in between each input
*/

/*Pasing implementation*/
/*while (nextline != null){
var temp[] = nextline.split();
var sisters[] = parseCSV(temp[2]);
var tempGear = new Gear(temp[0], temp[1]);
for (sisters: sisters[]) {
addSisters(tempGear, sister);
}
for (chlid: children[]) {
details omitted
}
totalGear.push(tempGear);
*/

/* Example:
gear1 50 gear2 none
gear2 100 none gear3,gear4
gear3 50 none none
gear4 20 none none
