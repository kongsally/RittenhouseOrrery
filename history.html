      <p>"Acquired in 1771 by the College of Philadelphia (later to be renamed
    the University of Pennsylvania), the Rittenhouse Orrery
    or planetarium was a mechanical device for reckoning, viewing,
    and studying the motions of the known planets and their moons.
    The scientific principles upon which the planetarium was conceived
    are two: first, the revolutionary sixteenth-century Copernican
    observations and proofs that the earth rotated elliptically
    around the sun and that the moon rotated around earth; and,
    second, seventeenth-century Newtonian mathematical theory,
    which was used to measure and calculate the properties of the
    natural world and universe.
    The College of Philadelphia was not the first mid-Atlantic college
    to purchase an orrery built by David Rittenhouse (1732-
    1796); the College of New Jersey (now Princeton) can make
    this claim. In hindsight, Philadelphia would benefit from Rittenhouse’s
    agreement to a chagrined Provost William Smith of
    the College that he would build a second orrery. The first was
    begun in 1767 at the request of Smith. However he was outbid
    by John Witherspoon, the Provost of Princeton, in April 1771.
    Smith felt the pang of Rittenhouse’s opportunism at the expense
    of his friend. Like Witherspoon, Smith was eager to acquire the
    Rittenhouse Orrery for the purpose of instruction and study at
    the College of Philadelphia in his planned course on Natural
    Philosophy, which included the field of astronomy. Smith’s surviving
    lectures from the period affirm his familiarity with Newton’s
    clockwork universe.
    Unlike his highly educated friend Provost William Smith (1727-
    1803), first Provost of the College of Philadelphia, Anglican clergyman,
    and Professor of Ethics, David Rittenhouse was born
    in humble circumstances on the banks of Wissahickon Creek in
    Germantown where his grandfather, William Rittenhouse, built
    the first paper mill in America. (The area was known as Rittenhouse
    Town, and the original mill buildings still survive.)
    The churning of the paper mill works must have made a profound
    impression on the formative mind of the young Rittenhouse.
    He was self-educated and by the time he was thirty,
    Rittenhouse was well-known locally as a clock and instrument
    maker, surveyor, astronomer, and mathematician. By the time of
    his death, he was honored internationally for his contributions
    to astronomy, and locally for his service to both the University
    of Pennsylvania and the newly formed national government of
    the United States.
    The orrery made in 1771 for Philadelphia demonstrates the motions
    of the known planets in the center panel, the moon in the
    right panel, and moons of Jupiter and Saturn in the left panel
    (now missing). Comprised of hundreds of gears and driven by
    a crank, the orrery was conceived to demonstrate the motion of
    the planets for 5,000 years. Unlike designers of other orreries,
    Rittenhouse successfully displayed the elliptical rotation of the
    planets, which was an unsurpassed technical achievement. The
    Rittenhouse Orrery is housed in an elegant Chippendale cabinet finely crafted in Philadelphia by John Holwell and Parnell Gibbs. The works and cabinet
    illustrate the sophisticated state of science, technology, and the practical arts in Philadelphia—the
    undisputed center of the American Enlightenment.
    Owned by the university for over two hundred years, and in practical use for instruction
    for fifty years, by the end of the nineteenth century the Rittenhouse Orrery was an
    elegant mechanical relic of an earlier era of scientific practice and study. In 1888, the
    orrery was moved from obscurity to a place of prominence in the university’s new state
    of the art academic library designed by Frank Furness. Moved a second time in 1962,
    the orrery was relocated to the Van Pelt Library where it continued to serve, as it had for
    two centuries, as the practical symbol of the university’s intellectual spirit and scientific
    quest to create new knowledge.
    In January 2013, the orrery made its ascent to its pride of place in the Penn libraries’ new
    Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts located on the sixth
    floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center. Although the orrery’s history and function
    is well documented, most contemporary visitors are daunted by its size and puzzled by
    its purpose. Still, the orrery commands awe and wonder for all who view this marvelous
    eighteenth-century astronomical teaching “apparatus.”
    Of its time, yet timeless, the Rittenhouse Orrery continues to serve as the supreme
    achievement of its creator, an American autodidact genius who was shaped by his family,
    period, acquaintances, politics, and his thirst to solve scientific problems and make
    discoveries that would lead to the advancement of knowledge and science expressed
    through innovation and technology.
    Rittenhouse’s carefully designed planetarium served a pedagogical purpose for the College
    of Philadelphia – to train students to study and observe the movement of matter
    across the night skies. Today, by comparison, it is not unlike the University of Pennsylvania’s
    investment in the new science of nanotechnology that focuses its quest inwardly
    to identify and capture the behavior of unobservable programmed matter, which may
    lead to unimagined discoveries and remedies to the most complex scientific and medical
    problems that humanity faces today. "</p>
